n8n Workflow: Torrent Tailor
  
This n8n workflow acts as your personal torrent curator: Triggered by Telegram messages, it intelligently parses movie queries with ChatGPT, searches 1337x for matches (bypassing Cloudflare via FlareSolverr), extracts magnet links, and queues them in qBittorrent. Everything logs to Google Sheets for easy tracking‚Äîtailored downloads, no fuss.
